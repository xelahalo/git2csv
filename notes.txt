git log --numstat 
- shows how many changes were made in each commit. This information was necessary for the determination of bounds for big/medium/small commits.

git log -w --numstat --find-renames --all --pretty=format:"%H;%an;%at;%s" 
- served as the main source of information about all commits we needed to process. Command prints hash, author, UNIX timestamp, a message of the commit as the first line. Each other line shows a number of additions, number of deletions, and names of files to which they belong.

git log --merges --first-parent --format="%H;%s" 
- returns all hashes and subjects of merges made to the master branch.

git log --merges --format="%H;%s" 
- similar option to the previous one; the information includes all merges between all branches.

git log --graph --remotes --pretty=format:"%H" 
- prints a graph showing sequence of commits and branches made in one Git repository.
